# Visualizations of CO2 emissions 

## The project's objectives
* Visualizations of a dataset on climate change.
> We chose to work on CO2 emissions, and thus to respond to several issues:

* See that CO2 emissions have been constantly increasing since the industrial period.
* See the most polluting countries by year
* Correlation between CO2 emissions and the increase in temperature.

## Skills
* D3.js for the visualizations on the web page. 
* Data clean using Pandas
* sci-kit learn to calculate the correlations or to make the predictions

## Dataset
* https://datahub.io/collections/climate-change

## Reference Code sources
* circle packing (bubble chart) for D3.js: https://d3-wiki.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/master/Pack-Layout/
* Linear regression in JS: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17407100/how-do-you-draw-linear-line-in-scatter-plot-with-d3-js

## Project objectives
* See that CO2 emissions have been constantly increasing since the industrial period
* See the most polluting countries by year / since a given year
* Verification of the correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature increase.
* To see if there is a link between CO2 emissions and sea level rise
